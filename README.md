I first examined each of the 3 declared Istio custom resources that are used to setup traffic routing to both the V1 and V2 versions of the sample web application. I tested the Istio traffic routing configuration that was applied, and confirmed that the traffic routing was approximately balanced (50/50) across both the V1 and V2 versions of the sample web application.
